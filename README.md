# OverBot

OverBot is a .py program that uses the BattleTags of Overwatch Players to record their game statistics. It then uses Discord's API to relay these statistics to a Discord server to allow members to easily search for player stats. 

Sadly, since the addition of private profiles to Overwatch, **private profiles cannot be added to the database.**
